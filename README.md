All the code for the front-end is in the public/ directory.

The webpages are hosted statically , you will need to install node packages to run the server on your local machine and have the server respond to login forms and etc.

To install node dependecies run 'npm install -y' in the root directory of the github repository.

To run the server locally type 'npm run dev1' in the root directory of the github repository. The server uses port 3000 by default.

Type 'localhost:3000/index.html' into your browser to access the homepage.
